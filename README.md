Welcome to my **Food Website**! This is a simple yet visually appealing website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The website features a variety of sections showcasing different food items, interactive elements, and an intuitive layout.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices (desktops, tablets, and mobiles).
- **Interactive Elements**: Built with JavaScript to provide interactive features like buttons, navigation, and pop-ups.
- **Food Showcase**: Sections highlighting various food categories and special dishes.
- **Smooth Navigation**: Simple, smooth scrolling and page transitions to enhance user experience.
- **Animations**: Visual transitions and hover effects created using CSS to make the website more dynamic.

## Technologies Used

This project uses the following technologies:

- **HTML**: The core structure of the website, providing the markup for all pages.
- **CSS**: Styling for the website, using flexbox and grid for layout management.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and dynamic content like handling clicks, animations, and event handling.

## Installation

Since this project is built using just **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, you can view it directly in your browser without the need for any special setup. 

To view the website locally:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Customizing

You can easily customize the content and styles of the website to fit your own brand or project:

- Update the websiteâ€™s styling by modifying the CSS files in the `/css` directory.
